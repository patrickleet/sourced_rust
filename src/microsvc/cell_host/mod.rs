//! Second command host: a celld Durable Object class analogue.
//!
//! Domain crates keep `CausalCommandContext` / `ctx.repo()`. This module is
//! the host adapter: one named cell per shard, private stream store, same
//! [`PortableCommand`] mounts as SOA `Routes`. It is **not** a sqlx dialect
//! and must not be gated behind `feature = "celld"` (`PCH-DEC-005`).
//!
//! Live celld fleet / CI is not required (`PCH-AC-006.1`). A workers-rs
//! `Send` tax stays in this adapter; cell types do not leak into domain
//! command declarations.
