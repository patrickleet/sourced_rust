//! Direct-transport receive traits.
//!
//! A direct broker client (Postgres, RabbitMQ, Kafka, NATS, or the in-memory
//! dev/test adapter) pulls messages with [`MessageSource`] and settles each
//! one through [`ReceivedMessage`]. The [`run_source`](super::run_source) runner
//! drives that loop: it dispatches through `Service::dispatch_message` and only
//! then asks the adapter to acknowledge.
//!
//! These are the *direct* receive shape. Knative / HTTP CloudEvents is a
//! separate ingress shape (the platform invokes an endpoint; there is no local
//! poll loop) and is intentionally not modeled through this trait.

/// - `Err(e)` — a transport-level receive failure, surfaced by the runner rather
///   than swallowed.
