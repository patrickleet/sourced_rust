# Gateway identity boundary

`AuthProvider` validates current `Credentials` and supplies `RequestContext` for
UI, API, assets and custom routes. Run authentication before each consumer's
route admission or delivery reuse; an expired assertion fails even on a public
route. `provider_revision` changes when provider policy/configuration changes.
An application can replace the provider without changing route declarations.
Contexts are in-process assertions and have no client deserializer.

`BackendCredential` is explicit: either none or a provider-supplied bearer.
The gateway does not translate a cookie or `x-user-id` into a credential.
A configured session provider may resolve an Auth.js session and supply its
access token; the backend must still validate that token and authorize the
operation. With `graphql` enabled, `graphql::identity::OidcGatewayProvider`
reuses the existing JWT validator, JWKS cache and role mapping. This optional
adapter does not make the portable gateway depend on GraphQL.

Delegate login/callback/refresh/logout to existing auth handlers. Configure
`AUTH_URL` as the public origin. Strip incoming identity and forwarded headers,
including deployment-specific identity/secret names, before adding trusted
public-origin metadata. Preserve Origin for CSRF and every Set-Cookie header.
Credentials are redacted from Debug output and are not cache keys.

The reusable production Auth.js/OIDC/browser fixture is in
`tests/gateway-auth`. Network adapters and application mounts own transport
plumbing; merely declaring routes or providers starts no service or identity
store. Removing a gateway mount restores the application's prior entrypoints;
backend authentication stays enabled.

## Native HTTP adapter

Enable `gateway-native` and construct `NativeGateway` from a validated gateway,
`NativeOptions`, explicit named `NativeBinding` resources and `NativeAuth`.
Mount its `router()` on the application's existing listener. Local handlers
receive `RequestContext` through Axum request extensions. UI proxy targets come
from the portable declaration; callers cannot select upstream URLs.

Use the real public origin in `NativeOptions::new`. Incoming identity and
forwarded headers are stripped; Host and forwarded host/protocol are rebuilt
from this value, while Origin is preserved for CSRF. Add deployment-specific
identity/secret header names to `strip_headers`. Upstream redirects are returned
to the browser, with private-origin locations mapped to public origin. The
proxy disables retries, automatic redirects, environment proxies and automatic
response decompression. Duplicate Set-Cookie values remain separate.

`ProxyLimits` bounds request bytes, active proxy streams, connect/header wait,
read idle time and upgraded-connection lifetime. Known oversize requests return
413; over-limit streamed uploads terminate rather than being retried. Capacity
exhaustion returns 503. Response bytes stream without a whole-body buffer;
dropping the body releases capacity and cancels its upstream stream. WebSocket
upgrades require an explicit target opt-in and close on disconnect, identity
expiry or configured lifetime. Exact public-origin loops fail construction;
a bounded hop chain also detects loops through aliases at runtime.

`StaticAssets` validates an immutable preloaded path/byte inventory and memory
budget. Protected assets run normal admission before lookup. It performs no
caller-selected filesystem access. Native construction starts no listener,
projector or event consumer. Disabling this mount restores previous entrypoints.
