//! Replay-determinism property tests.
//!
//! Event sourcing's core promise is that an aggregate's state is a pure
//! function of its event stream. These proptests generate arbitrary command
//! sequences for a sample aggregate and assert two invariants that the recent
//! publish-on-commit + snapshot work depends on:
//!
//! 1. **Reload determinism** — applying commands in memory and reloading from
//!    storage yields identical state. (round-trip is lossless)
//! 2. **Snapshot transparency** — a snapshot-hydrated reload equals a
//!    full-replay reload, for *any* snapshot frequency. Snapshots are an
//!    optimization that must never change observable state.
