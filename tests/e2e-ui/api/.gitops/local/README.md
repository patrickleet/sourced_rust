# e2e-ui coherent application chart

This cluster-development chart renders one Deployment running
`distributed dev` for the complete editable application. The lifecycle owns
the Rust API, SvelteKit UI, generated clients, linked framework JavaScript,
and generation activation. Two Services expose ports 8791 and 5180 from that
one lifecycle participant set.

Hops supplies the source mount or sync delivery. A Node init container places
the pinned Node/npm toolchain beside the Rust toolchain without a custom local
image or chart-level package installer. The linked framework package pins and
installs its required `wasm-pack` compiler, so declared Rust/WASM pures are
built inside the same lifecycle too. Dependency and framework builds are owned
by `distributed dev`, not by chart shell scripts or a second UI Deployment.

OIDC project, demo humans, and web application resources live in the explicit
`ui/.gitops/test-users` chart. When identity is enabled, this chart consumes
the same generation-specific connection Secret for the API audience and the
UI client credentials.

Platform AuthStack, ProviderConfig, and the shared PSQLCluster stay under the
project `.gitops/local/cluster/` tree. Cloud images belong to the independent
`.gitops/deploy` chart.
